MAP LAYERS:

We need at least three layers to represent that multiple things can exist on the same tile simultaneously.

Examples:
- Pickups can be hidden under dirt blocks.
- Creatures or dirt blocks can be stacked on top of a clone machine.
- Creatures are on top of various floor types (floor, gravel, ice, force field)

Principles to follow:
1) Chip should occupy the first (top) layer.
2) Creatures should occupy the second layer (because Chip and creatures should be able to occupy the same space).
3) Walls (including dirt blocks) should occupy the third layer (because pop-up walls can go underneath creatures).
4) Pickups (chips, keys, boots) should occupy the fourth layer (because pickups can be hidden beneath dirt blocks).
5) Floor types (floor, thin walls, fire, water, ice, force field, gravel, buttons, unpopped wall, bear trap, bomb, teleport, clue, exit) and the clone machine should occupy the fifth (bottom) layer.

ENTITIES VS. STATIC

- player, monsters, and dirt blocks are entities
- everything else is static
- but what about red/brown buttons, and the things they're wired to?
  - keep a dictionary of these connections
  - in your map data, make the id at the button have a longer serial to indicate the row/col of the object it's connected to
